## Nueroflow Backend Assessment


### Background
For this project, please create a small backend REST API which fulfills the requirements written below

Requirements:

Create a web REST application with a '/mood' endpoint, which when POSTed to persists the
submitted mood value.
Add the ability for users to login.
Create a '/mood' endpoint with a GET method, returning all values submitted by the logged-in
user.
Add to the body of the response for the ‘/mood’ endpoint the length of their current "streak".
- A user is on a “streak” if that user has submitted at least 1 mood rating for each consecutive day of that streak. For example, if on March 1st, March 2nd, March 3rd, and March 5th the user entered mood ratings, a 3-day streak will apply to the March 3rd rating and the streak will reset to a 1-day streak for the March 5th rating.

## How to use the program

1) Git clone the repo to your IDE using 
```
git clone https://github.com/tyler-ostinato/nueroflow_backend_assesment.git 
```
2) Install the required packages by creating a virtual environment
```
python3.8 -m venv .venv
```
and start the virtual environment using
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
3) Install the required libraries using
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3) To start the frontend which will allow users to login and see their results, run the following commands in the terminal.
```
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```
Look for a link in the terminal that will direct you to the home page of the application. Should look similar to http://192.168.1.22:5000/. This page will allow a user to create or sign in to an existing account.

5) Next run the /mood endpoint to load the user data.
```
export FLASK_APP=mood.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001
```
This will the user to use GET and POST to interact with their data manually, or use the frontend GUI.

## Testing

Now we can begin using the app. Going to http://192.168.1.22:5000/ will load the home page where a user can sign up or log in. Once logged in teh user will see a JSON payload containing their past moods as well as their current streak of days logged in. 

If the user chooses not to use the GUI of the website, the API can also be called directly. 

GET Method -
To get the data of a user we can use the following

http://192.168.1.22:5001/mood?user=(username)

for example http://192.168.1.22:5001/mood?user=test_user2 will bring up the past moods and current streak of user "test_user2".

POST Method -
A user can submit a new mood using POST. For my testing purposes I used Postman which is a useful API platform that makes sending POST requests easy. The post will take a JSON payload similiar to 

```json
{
    "user":"username",
    "mood":"Current Mood"
}
```
A successful run will return a status of 200 and a payload similar to
```json
{
    "Date": "Sun, 28 Nov 2021 17:17:08 GMT",
    "Mood": "Current Mood"
}
```

## Questions
Document what, if anything, you would do differently if this were a production application and not an assessment? What tech would you use? How would you handle things differently if it needed to handle more users, more data, etc?

- If this were a production application I would need to look more into security. For example, using the GET request for the /mood endpoint we can pass an username and see the data of that user. In reality we would need to prevent unauthorized users getting access to someone else's data. I would probably get rid of the /mood?user="" parameter and only allow access to the data through the website which is more secure. 

- Another imporvement would have to be the front end for the users. Currently I am only returning a JSON payload of the information for the user. Ideally with more time I would implement some more JS, CSS, and HTML to make a nice user interface and maybe some basic statistics of the user. 

- As for storing the user data I would use a different database then the flask sqlite database I am using. This is not an efficient use of storing user data as it is limited to my computer and the size of the .db file. In production I would need something faster, more resilient, and more secure.
